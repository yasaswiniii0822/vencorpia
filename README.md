this file contains my the details of my understanding and thought process while creating the ui
according to my understanding event management is all about TRUST. the user(customer) invests their money on us and we should give utmost importance in making sure that our website resonates that. the ui should be in a way that the user should subconsciously build trust on us. this formed the base of the ui

the dark navy- builds trust
gold accents- premium feel
teal accents- staying true to the logo

i wanted the ui to be simple,straight forward
